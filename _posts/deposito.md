              <p class="lead">Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
              directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
              a converter (like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>)
              and our <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> renderer, and
              spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable
              for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine
              behind <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which means you can use Jekyll
              to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers <strong>for
              free</strong>.</p>
